PARADE
  UNDE : Paradise
  BREF : {(link "Parade")} is an experimental operating system inspired from {(link "Paradise")}.
  BODY
    & The {(bold "Parade")} is an experimental operating system using {(link "Paradise")} as a {(ital "filesystem")}.
    & The goal of this project is to distribute a lightweight operating system that would serve a cli environment allowing the user to {(link "https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1042644335689261058" "navigate the file system")}, its applications and to exchange content with other users using the basic interaction scheme of {(link "Paradise")}.
    # create the machine
    # > |
    & There would be no "users", "files" or "applications", all these would be combined into the operable "vessel" paradigm. A {(bold "vessel")} is an kind of {(ital "application")} that can act onto other vessels, it has its own permissions. Users are not different from applications or files. A {(ital "user")}, is a vessel being acted upon, possibly containing other vessels. A {(ital "file")} is an inert vessel, that has no applicable actions to itself.
    # enter the machine
    # > |
    & A basic vessel would have the basic actions of Paradise(enter, leave, take, drop, ...), and visible vessels might append to that list, actions of their own. The vessel format serves endpoints that respond to actions. For instance, an telephone vessel, might respond to the action {(ital "use")}, as in the command "use the telephone", which might or might not be what the acting vessel intended for. — Or, a more Parade-like vessel would be that of a contact card vessel granting the action {(ital "call")}, as in "call alex".
    & There is no linear hierarchy tree, instead vessels can be within themselves or each other, or even organized in the shape of a loop. Pockets of space can be hosts to vessels existing around a common purpose, or carried around inside another vessel as you would a tool-belt or an inventory, giving the acting vessel, or {(ital "user")}, additional actions and options.
    # become the machine
    # > |
    & One of the targets of this operating system is to be {(bold "fully operable without a monitor")}, via voice. The navigation is designed to be used via simple text commands, there would be nothing quite like windows. Vessels could display passive content when in sight, allowing to create a form of procedural user interface, but the system itself does not have a concept of windows, like you would in a typical graphical operating system with a wm.
    & While the navigation of the system can be done by voice alone, the terminal, when presented on a screen, has an {(bold "input")}, a {(bold "history of responses")} from previous actions and a {(bold "display area for graphics")}.
    # use the machine
    # > |
    & At its core the system should be {(bold "single-threaded")}, and operate a single frame, or a {(ital "state")}, of the world at a time, as a singular runtime. While passive responses of visible vessels might allow for a kind of oversight, the user experience as a terminal, and down to its functioning should not allow for multi-tasking.
    & The creation of application vessels, think for instance a {(ital "drawing application")}, would be built with the LISP dialect of Parade, which is itself built with that same language. — Making the entire operating system existing it inself as a vessel, editable, changeable, operable and navigable.
    # warp to the lobby@29:03:25:76
    # > |
    & A {(bold "Network of Parade systems")} would be traversible(read-only) by an acting vessel. The Parade's typical behaviours for moving about will persist onto the remote systems so, a vessel can move, enter, use remote vessels and suggest changes to the host world as commits — All the while, respecting the host's vessel permissions. For instance, a vessel might make itself usable by a visiting vessel, but will not let itself be moved or altered.

    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.
